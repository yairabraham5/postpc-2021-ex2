i solemnly swear that I did this project by myself:)

Answer to Question:
To support multiplication we need to add functions to the calculator implementation.
We also need to a listener to the multiplication button in the main activity.
We can test the logic of the multiplication logic on the calculator.
Adittionally test the UI on the activity and the UI on the app.



# AndroidCalculator - Calculator exercise for Android developers

## In this project:
- Calculator screen with XML ready for portrait and landscape
- Calculator interface used by the Activity
- Unit tests for the calculator and the activity

## Your job:
- Implement `SimpleCalculatorImpl.java`
- add more unit tests to `SimpleCalculatorImpl.java`
- Implement `MainActivity.java`
- add more unit tests to `MainActivityTest.java`
- add more flow tests to `AppFlowTest.java`

Basically look for "TODO" in the code.


Good luck!
